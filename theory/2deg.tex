A two dimensional electron gas or 2DEG for short is characterized by the confinement of electron movement in one direction and free movement in two others. 
Electron systems with high lateral mobility can be realized in numerous ways ranging from transistors, surfaces of suited materials \cite{PhysRevLett.12.271} or heterojunctions \cite{JVSTB.4.853}. Structures containing 2DEGs are very versatile as they are easily fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy and modified by ion beam lithography \cite{Ingram1995}\cite{Nowack2009Thesis} or even rolled up \cite{Vorob'ev2004171}.
The tight confinement necessary can be realized for example by the joining of two semiconducting materials with distinct band gaps and \textsc{Fermi} energies. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hetero2deg} when joined the \textsc{Fermi} energies of both materials seek equilibrium bending the conduction and valance bands at the interface in the process.

The bending of the conductance band below the \textsc{Fermi} energy of the combined heterostructure creates a very pronounced dip in the bandstructure resulting in a potentiall well where the electrons can move freely. The confinement perpendicular to the 2DEG however leads to quantized energy levels of motion in that direction as can be seen in Fig. (\ref{fig:potentialwell}) (a) and (b) for three states with different cutoff(band bottom) energies. The offset coduction bands can often be treated independendly. Usually the lowest energy level comprises the 2DEG.
