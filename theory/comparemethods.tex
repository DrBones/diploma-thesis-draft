The \gfnc{} formulation of quantum mechanics is not the only possible method to compute the transport properties desired.\par
There exist numerous approaches to analytical and numerical calculation of quantum mechanical observalbles only a selection will be presented here. A detailed discussion of the Formulations presented in tab.(\ref{tab:comparison}) can be found in \cite{Biegel97quantumelectronic}. The table lists the capabilities and numerical efficiency in a direct computation. It includes for reference the classical \textsc{Boltzmann} Transport Equation (BTE), the \sdg{} Equation (SE), the Transfer Matrix (TM), Density Matrix (DM), \cgfnc{} and \textsc{Wigner} Function formulations.\par

The most obvious method the direct solution of the \sdg{} is unsuitable for a couple of reasons.In a many body theory it soon becomes unmanagebly complex for a rising number of carriers inside the conductor. Also absorbing boundary conditions and inelastic scattering have not been treated accurately \cite{Biegel97quantumelectronic} although developement has not halted \cite{JApplPhys.69.7153}\cite{gullapalli:2971}\par
A popular quantum device simulation method capable of describing steady state transport in a fast and straight forward to implement way is the so called Transfer Matrix Method (TMM)\cite{MacKinnon2003}.\par
TMM formulations are in general unstable because possible evanescent waves will lead to unphysically fast rising matrix coefficients \cite{PhysRevB.38.9945}.
While the instability issues can be resolved using a redesigned TMM technique by T.Usuki \cite{PhysRevB.50.7615}\cite{PhysRevB.52.8244} as a direct descendend of the \sdg{} the TMM presents the same theoretical limitations.\par
A different approach in spirit related to the solution of classical electronic systems via a \textsc{Boltzmann} transport equation present quantum statistical formulations. 
Due to the nature of many body systems a statistical state function even in the limit of non-interacting particle should present a quite accurate representation of the 2DEG.\par
The choice of a \gfnc{} as a state function has several advantages over a \textsc{Wigner} function or density matrix approach.
The more general formalism makes it more flexible and powerful because it also profits from advances in the solution to \gfnc{} which can be applied in a diverse field.\par
The the application of all quantum statistical formulations is currently limited to systems of reduced size or resolution as the computations involved are highly sensitive to the discretization.\par
An advantage of the \gfnc{} method over other state functions in relation to the implementation on a computer is the development of fast and efficient algorithms suitable to compute all the desired observables\cite{JApplPhys.91.2343} in two or even three dimensions or in a parallel computing environment \cite{Drouvelis2006parallel}.
