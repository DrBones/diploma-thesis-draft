The algorithms and logic are mainly implemented in a programming language called \emph{python}. As an interpreted scripting language python has a lower performance in comparison to low level languages like FORTRAN or C. However, the usability, powerful numerical modules and the large scientific userbase makes it a suitable choice to write a physical simulator.\par
Because of pythons object orientation, libraries written in lower level programming languages can be used for computational-expensive operations.\par
There exists a large suite of numerical modules wrapping fast numerical algebra routines like BLAS, ATLAS or MKL called \emph{numpy} \cite{numpy} which is used for the simulations in this work for high performance computations.\par
Higher level mathematical functions and operations like the \textsc{Schur} decomposition are part of \emph{scipy} \cite{scipy} which is a superpackage of numpy.\par
The RGA is implemented in pure python on top of the numeric algebra package with the addition of custom routines.\par
For the handling of graph based calculations and reorderings \emph{networkx} \cite{networkx} is employed. The networkx package supplies a graph class upon which the custom BFS and graph partitioning algorithm used by \textsc{Wimmer} are also written in pure python to ensure interoperability.
