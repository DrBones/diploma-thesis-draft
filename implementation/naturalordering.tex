The now finite dimension of the matrices obtained by inclusion of the self energy term is determined by the number of lattice points which make up the discretized system.
If a reasonable resolution i.e lattice spacing in the nanometer range is desired the number of lattice-points easily exceeds magnitudes of $10^5$ for a mesoscopic device in the range of micrometers which would lead. 
The number of lattice point neccessary for inclusion can be reduced if only the point are taken that constitute the device and discard the sourrounding environment effectively mapping the full rectangular lattice to a \emph{sparse grid}. Especially for devices of varying transverse extent this often reduces the size of the matrix by a factor of two or more.\par
The full inversion of matrices of this size has still high demands on memory and computational power due to its $\mathcal{O}(\text{Number of lattice-points})$ complexity and is therefore, even with specialised direct algorithms such as LU decomposition based inversion, a very time-consuming affair\cite{Datta2000.2.53} and \cite{Li2009Thesis}.\par
Therefore faster and more efficient techniques for the computation of the \gfnc{} are desireable.\par
For structures of serial nature i.e relatively narrow structures with colinear leads like a quantum wire the \hamil{} turns out to be in a block tri-diagonal form a \emph{natural ordering}. This natural ordering leads to so called \emph{layered devices} seen in fig. (\ref{fig:layered}) in which the device is cut into slices perpendicular to the longest dimension as shown in chapter \ref{sec:discretematrixrep}. There exist several techniques for example based on \textsc{Takahashi}'s observation \cite{Takahashi1973} or the \textsc{Dyson} equation that deliver much higher performance.
