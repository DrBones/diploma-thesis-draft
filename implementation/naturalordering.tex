Typical nano structures in a 2DEG usually include constraints to limit the flow of electrons or spin in a particular way to achieve some kind of two dimensional circuit. Within this circuit different spin-tronical devices are located to control and manipulate the flow of information. These structures range from simple wires to complex spin filter cascades, \textsc{Hall} bars
